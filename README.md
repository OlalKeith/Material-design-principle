# THERE ARE ABOUT 12 PRINCIPLES OF MATERIAL DESIGN JUST TO MENTION A FEW. 

## 1. Get familiar with the main resource:
Atleast familiarize  with the basic principle.

## 2. Understand the “material” in material design:
The whole idea behind the principles of material design is to make designs resemble the real world, but only at a certain level of abstraction, atleast to convey the idea of “material” to the user.

## 3. Use bold colors:
Being ***bold***, ***graphic***, and ***intentional*** is one of the three main principles of material design.Bold colors serve a really important role in material design they make things fun and make interacting with the design enjoyable to the user.

## 4. Use primary color and accent color:
The way to adapt this to any type of design could be: select three hues that will make up your primary palette, plus one color that’s going to act as the accent.

Your primary colors can be used for things like backgrounds, fields, boxes, fonts, and other key elements of the interface. The accent color is just what the name suggests – it gives you additional leverage when you want to display the main element on a given screen/page.

## 5. Utilize whitespace.
Whitespace is an important element in any material design, and it can improve your typography and text layout immensely.

In fact, whitespace is the most effective tool for creating focus, grabbing the user’s attention and bringing it to a particular element (something that beginner designers often have trouble understanding).

So in short, utilize some large-scale typography for headlines, add a lot of whitespace, and don’t be afraid to have a lot of blank spaces in your designs overall.

## 6. Use edge-to-edge images.
Material design is really image-friendly. What I mean here is that if you decide to include any images in your design, you should give them a leading role.

Images in material design are featured edge-to-edge. This means that there are no margins between the edge of the image and the edge of the window/screen.

When done correctly, this creates an enticing experience for the user, and also gives us – the designers – some additional design tools among the rather small set of pre-approved shadows, color palettes, and layers.

## 7. Incorporate motion.
Material design uses motion to interact with the user, effectively letting them know how to use the design.

What to put in motion? Simply give the user some feedback about the action they’ve just performed. For example, did they click a button? Animate it to confirm that the input was received.

## 8. Make motion authentic.
“Authentic” is the keyword here. The days of fake motion – things just moving about the screen – are long gone.
In material design, motion is only as good as its ability to mimic the motion of real-life items. This is the only way in which motion will enrich the interface and make it more understandable to the user.

## 9. Make everything responsive.
One of the main principles of material design is to make the resulting work accessible and usable on any device and any screen size. Above all else, the goal is to make the experience consistent.

Naturally, this means that the design needs to be responsive. Luckily, with modern frameworks, you get much of the scaffolding already built, so making your work responsive shouldn’t be that big of a challenge.

## 10. Remember, everything’s in the details.
One of the main elements that make material design so difficult to execute flawlessly is that it’s so heavily simplified.
With material design, it’s a bit simpler, yet more complicated at the same time.

For the most part, material design is a game of details. You need just a little realism to convey the main functionality and purpose of the thing you’re designing, but at the same time, you don’t want to make things too skeuomorphic.
